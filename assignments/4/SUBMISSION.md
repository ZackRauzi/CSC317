Zack's Calculator:

I know I probably could have wrote the calculator very leveraging javascript's built in "eval" function.
This would allow me to take a string "10 + 2 - 5" and it would evaluate it to 7.

I wanted to try and not rely on javascript's built in functions in my approach, and write everything from scratch.

I modeled my calculator to be similar to simple calculators that only allow one operation at a time.

My approach was pretty simple, I only needed 2 numbers to be stored at any time:
  - Input: whatever the user was inputting
  - Output: whatever the previous number input was

Whenever a new input was entered, it would be used to modify (+,-,*,/) the output.

Then when the user presses the = button, the output is displayed.

Then I just used some basic html/css to try and copy the design of the apple calculator the best I could.

I did not complete project 3 so I was unable to add the calculator to project 3.
