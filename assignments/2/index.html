        <h4>I'm a computer science student at SFSU.  Before SFSU I earned an associates in Film/Electronic Media.
            In my spare time I like to make websites and build games in Unity.  I also love to travel and spearfish.

        <h4>Audio Visualization Project</h4>
        <img src="images/audioVisualization.png" alt="audio visualization visual aid loading..." width="812" height="500">
        <h4>This is a small project I made in unity.  I found Unity has a built in method <b>AudioSource.GetSpectrumData</b>, which will return an array of audio spectrum values based on an input audio track.
            I thought this could be a cool feature to implement in a game in the future, so I created this project to familiarize myself with the data provided by the GetSpectrumData method.
            Cubes are spawned in a circle, and every frame they are updated to match their corresponding array data.  This creates a cool vizualiation effect.  I also added modifiers so I can adjust the cube size, amplitude, and how many are spawned.

        <h4>"Dragos Journey" - Monster Catching Game</h4>

        <h4>This is a game I made in Unity as a final project for my game design course.  I created a platformer with wasd movement and a jump.  The player can also interact with the environment.
            There are mushrooms, which provide a jump boost, and ladders to go up and down.  There are also monsters, that cause the player to start at the begining of the level upon being hit.
